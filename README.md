# Nightmarish Diet
A turn-based Roguelike game made in Unity. This project was one of the first I've created using Unity engine and was developed based on the Turn-based Roguelike tutorial, which can be found [here](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-roguelike-tutorial).

In this game, you play as a man who is on a diet and trying to escape the map without eating too much food. The food items are constantly following the man, and their count increases on the map as the level progresses. When the man eats the food, he gets fat, but he gets slim when he takes turns.

## Instructions
To play the game, simply download the repository and open the project in Unity. The game is played using the arrow keys. There is also an apk file, which can be run on Android, but gameplay won't work because the game only permits arrow keys as an input.

## Repository Status
This repository is now archived, and no further development or updates will be made. However, feel free to clone or fork the repository if you want to use the code or the art for your own project.
